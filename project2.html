							<h4> The Problem</h4>
							<p>
                                The objective of this analysis is to mine the dataset provided by the City of New York containing 
                                information about car crashes that take place in the five (5) boroughs: Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, 
                                Brooklyn, and Staten Island. Firstly, we will be taking a look at the trends in the 
                                data on a macro scale for the years of 2019 and 2020 (that is, to look at general trends in the 
                                data) and then we will focus on the trends of two smaller groups:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The months of June - July</li>
                                    <li>The borough of Manhattan</li>
                                </ol>
                                We aim to understand some of the main reasons for car crashes and potentially suggest solutions
                                to this. 
                            </p>

							<h4> The Analysis</h4>
							<p>  
                                Before being able to produce insights from the data set, the first step was to thoroughly clean 
                                the data. It was observed that the raw data was very unclean. For processing, the data was loaded into 
                                a Pandas dataframe. Firstly, we separated the Crash Date column into a year, month, and day column 
                                so that they can be used later for: a granular temporal analysis, it would be easier to group the 
                                data, and it would be easier to create data visualizations. Secondly, we ensured correct attribute 
                                data type. It is important that data types are consistent with the given data in the column so data 
                                can be interpreted easily, ambiguity is reduced, that any model done on the data will perform predictably, 
                                and because inconsistent data types can lead to confusion and errors during the data mining process. 

                                <pre>
                                    <code>
crash_data = pd.read_csv(file) 

# convert date to datetime format and separate it into date, month, year
crash_data[['CRASH MONTH', 'CRASH DAY', 'CRASH YEAR']] = crash_data['CRASH DATE'].str.split('/', expand=True)
crash_data = crash_data.drop(columns=['CRASH DATE'])
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                                The original columns in the dataframe: 
                                <pre>
                                    <code>
Index(['CRASH DATE', 'CRASH TIME', 'BOROUGH', 'ZIP CODE', 'LATITUDE',
'LONGITUDE', 'LOCATION', 'ON STREET NAME', 'CROSS STREET NAME',
'OFF STREET NAME', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED',
'NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED', 'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED',
'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED', 'NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED',
'NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED', 'NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED',
'NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1',
'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3',
'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5',
'COLLISION_ID', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2',
'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5'],
dtype='object')
                                    </code>
                                </pre>

                                Secondly, we ensured
                                correct attribute data type. It is important that data types are consistent with the given data in
                                the column so data can be interpreted easily, ambiguity is reduced, that any model done on the
                                data will perform predictably, and because inconsistent data types can lead to confusion and
                                errors during the data mining process.

                                <div id="data_type_images">
                                    <div class="image-container">
                                        <img src="images/data types before.png" alt="Data Types Before">
                                    </div>
                                
                                    <div class="image-container">
                                        <img src="images/data types after.png" alt="Data Types After">
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                Afterwards, we addressed the missing values in the dataframe. For attributes of an int or float
                                data types, missing values were replaced with the value of “-1”. The missing values of other
                                attributes were replaced with “”. Next, we reduced the amount of data present in the dataframe.
                                The major objective of this assignment was to analyze the trends in the boroughs of New York.
                                Therefore, any rows without a borough present were removed from the dataframe. The column
                                “LOCATION” was also dropped because it was simply a concatenation of the latitude and
                                longitude columns already present in the dataframe. Records with crash years less than 2019
                                and greater than 2020 were also removed. We also looked at the unique values present for the
                                attributes of vehicle type codes and contributing factors. To properly clean the data, it would be
                                best to either remove values that were nonsensical or replace them with a sensible value. Given
                                that the incorrect values were plentiful, this would be an extensive process and is something
                                that could be tackled in a further revision of this project.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Another step taken in the data preparation process was to split (quantize) the data into the
                                five(5) boroughs and save the data to separate csv files. Therefore, when analyzing data
                                specific to a borough, there is less data to manipulate and would aid in speeding up the run time
                                for these processes. Lastly, we take a look at the amount of records present in the dataframe
                                after cleaning. There are nearly twice as many records for the year 2020 compared to the year
                                2019. Additionally, the amount of records per borough vary widely. Initially, we suspected that
                                this is likely due to the relative size and density of each of the boroughs. However, according to
                                the information provided from a 2020 census, the most densely populated borough is
                                Manhattan, having nearly twice the density than the next largest densely populated borough,
                                Brooklyn. Brooklyn has nearly twice as many accidents as Manhattan. Queens is the second
                                least densely populated borough but yet has nearly as many accidents as Brooklyn. Reasons
                                for the inconsistencies which could be further explored include:
                                - Boroughs with higher economic activities would have more vehicular traffic leading to
                                higher probability of accidents
                                - Boroughs with more established public transport could have less accidents
                                - Boroughs with higher enforcement of traffic laws could have less accidents
                                - Boroughs may have different designs and conditions of infrastructure such as road
                                design, road maintenance and traffic signals.
